    <p>
        Alice's Adventures Under Ground was the precursor to Alice in Wonderland written by Lewis Carroll. The goal of this project was to preserve and
        cut down on unnecessary ramblings or deviations from the actual plot of the story. We have marked these sections as "yap" and made a seperate
        version of the text which has been stripped of these deviations and made the text much shorter and to the point. A color coded view of this text
        was also made to highlight characters, figurative language, and any markings from the original source.
